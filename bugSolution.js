The solution involves a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Clean the cache:**  Run `expo prebuild --clean` before attempting to build. This removes cached build artifacts and ensures a fresh build process.
2. **Reinstall dependencies:** Run `expo install` to ensure all project dependencies are up to date and correctly installed.  Manually checking `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for discrepancies is recommended.
3. **Verify network connectivity:**  Ensure a stable and reliable internet connection throughout the build process. Network interruptions can disrupt dependency downloads.
4. **Check Android SDK setup:** Verify the Android SDK installation is complete, correctly configured, and all necessary components (like build-tools) are up to date. Consult Android's official documentation for proper setup.
5. **Update Expo and React Native versions:** Update the project dependencies to the latest versions of Expo and React Native to benefit from bug fixes and improvements.
6. **Rebuild the project on a different machine:** To isolate issues specific to the development environment, try building the app on a different machine.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
expo prebuild --clean;
expo install;
expo build:android;
```
