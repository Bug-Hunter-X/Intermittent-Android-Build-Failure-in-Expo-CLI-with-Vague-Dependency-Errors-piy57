# Intermittent Android Build Failure in Expo CLI with Vague Dependency Errors

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when building Android apps using the Expo CLI. The build process intermittently fails with vague error messages related to missing or incorrect dependencies.  The problem's inconsistency makes debugging challenging.

## Bug Description
The Expo CLI Android build process fails unexpectedly. Error messages lack specificity, making it difficult to pinpoint the root cause. The build might hang or terminate abruptly at different stages.  The issue does not occur consistently, and the same project might build successfully on other attempts or machines.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Attempt to build the Android app using `expo build:android`.  Repeat this step several times; the build may succeed on some attempts and fail on others.

## Potential Causes
* **Cached dependencies:** Expo CLI's caching mechanism might sometimes lead to corrupted or outdated packages.
* **Network issues:** Intermittent network connectivity can cause dependency downloads to fail.
* **Underlying Android SDK issues:**  Problems within the Android SDK itself could contribute to the problem.
* **Concurrent processes:** Build failures might occur due to interference from other processes running on the system.

## Workarounds and Solutions
The provided `bugSolution.js` demonstrates potential solutions, including cleaning the cache, reinstalling dependencies, and checking the network connection. This might involve manually resolving dependency conflicts or ensuring the Android environment's proper setup.
